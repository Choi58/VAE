**[ðŸ“„ [arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)**

> ðŸ“Œ PyTorch implementation of the VAE model described in **"Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes" (Kingma & Welling, 2014)**.  
> **Type:** Personal project / Academic presentation  
> **Goal:** Reproduce the vanilla VAE architecture for generative image modeling using the CelebA dataset.

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on facial images. The model learns a latent distribution of the training data and generates new samples by decoding points drawn from the learned latent space.  
The results were presented at **Korea University Academic Festival, 2022** as a demonstration of generative modeling through variational inference.
